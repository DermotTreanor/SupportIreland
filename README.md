# Support Ireland

Welcome to Support Ireland, a prototype website aiming to centralize information about in-person peer support groups across Ireland.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to create a user-friendly platform where individuals can easily discover and access information about various in-person support groups in Ireland. The intention is to provide a centralized resource, eliminating the need for users to go multiple sites to find the groups.

## Features
- **Listing of Support Groups:** Browse through a list of available in-person peer support groups.
- **Filtering Options (this is just planned for now):** Select your group or area to filter and view relevant meeting details.

## Usage
1. Visit the index file to see the home page.
2. Future updates will introduce filtering options.

## Contributing
Contributions are allowed. Please submit a pull request or make an issue.
